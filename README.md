# Course project

This project is a app to help student improve student reading and writing ability by sentimental and keywork analysis

The source is provided in **web**


## Software installation


First install the azure coginitive services package service.


Then direct run 

```
python textanalysis.py
```

The result will be rendered in textanalyticresult.docx



##  Result of the project

In the rendered, according to every sentence, it will give a score to the phrase. Sentimental analysis will be given to each one of sentences. The high scores on both positive and negetive will be noticed because it does not follow the require neutral tone of the essay.

050B.docx is the sample file we test for the sentimental analysis.

For grammercheck.py, it is the code for checking the right wording for the whole paper.

Main.py will be the user side code for this project


## Discussion

We have not complete what we planned, we start educationweb and completely failed to installed. We switched to this sentimental analysis project for the paper instead. We have complete the project for giving feedbacks on the sentiment and giving scores for the sentimentals. We do not have the time to imporve the frontend which we planned to do initially. We may work on it later after the semester to make it a better one.
